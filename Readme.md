# Video store

Video store code from Martin
Fowler [blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-video-store-js/)  
The code has already some tests, so you can concentrate in refactoring it.

### Task

We should now support also DOCUMENTARIES genre. <br/>
Documentaries are rented using a flat pricing strategy (price doesn't depend on the number of days).
Price is set at 2.5. <br/>
Renting a documentary doesn't give any frequent renter point to the customer. <br/>
Movies that don't give any frequent renter point should be marked with an asterisk (*) on the
receipt statement.
